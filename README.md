# Exploratory Data Analysis - Course Project 2
he overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008. 
This repository contains the files needed to  address the following questions:
1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
* It is answered by ***plot1.png*** generated by ***plot1.R***

2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips=="24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these  four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips=="06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
